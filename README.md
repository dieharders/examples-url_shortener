## [Try Live Demo](https://example-url-shortener.web.app)
A sample project that uses the bit.ly API to shorten URLs and copy them to the OS clipboard.

This is a small javascript example to show how to create a function that will connect to the bit.ly API and use it to shorten the current web page's url. JQuery is used to aid in cross-site request validation when loading credentials from an external source.

There is also a button used to copy the shortened url to the User's clipboard or one can select the link directly from the form.
